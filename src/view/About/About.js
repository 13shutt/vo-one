            For more than 8 years I have been working in the international companies that develop products and business solutions for the markets of the USA, Europe, and Scandinavia. My major responsibilities were the development and support of big high-load projects using the most innovative technologies available. I like to challenge myself and always seek for new ways of improvement and find the most appropriate solutions to difficult tasks. My life is experienced only in moving forward.
